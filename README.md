# DeepLearningWithTensorFlowAndKeras3rdEdition
This is my walk through of the code for the book "Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras, 3rd Edition" found at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow-and-Keras-3rd-edition.

Most chapters are in their own folder, and the code is in multiple .py files, not .ipynb. I am going to create one .ipynb file per chapter, importing the code found in the .py files, just because I think the code will be easier to explore and play with.
